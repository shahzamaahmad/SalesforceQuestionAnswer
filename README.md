Examples of PaaS cloud providers.
Google App Engine.
Salesforce Force.com
Azure
E.g., Salesforce: Force.com can be accessed using Developer Console 
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
In Infrastructure as a Service model, the cloud service providers will provide infrastructure like Servers, hosting services. Here we don’t have any final product or a platform to develop application, here we have a space to setup platform and then we have to build the application and use it.
Examples of IaaS cloud providers.
Amazon EC2 and S3.

### Question10: Difference between Salesforce.com and Force.com?
Salesforce.com and fore.com are relatively same but they are different in their functionality. 
Salesforce.com is used to develop CRM functionality-based application where force.com is used to customize our data model, business logic and User interface. 

### Question11: What is Object in Salesforce?
Object 🡪 Table 🡪 Collection of Rows/Columns 
An Objects is represented as a database table which stores organization data. 
Objects consists of set of fields, and we store data against that field. 
To view data Salesforce provided TABS.
Salesforce Classic: Setup -> Objects -> New Object 
Salesforce Lightning Experience: Setup -> Object Manager -> New Object 
### Question12:  Different types of objects in Salesforce.com? And why they called so?
In Salesforce.com we have two types of objects. They are
Standard objects
Custom Objects
Standard Objects: - Standard objects are called so because they are created and provided by Salesforce.com.
E.g., Campaigns, Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Products, Assets, Entitlements & Cases etc. 
Custom Objects: - Custom objects are those which are created by a User in salesforce.com.
E.g., Faculties, Students, Courses, Enrollments & Doctors etc. 
### Question13: What is TAB in Salesforce?
Salesforce.com provides list of tabs and are placed in Tab menu. 
To access data of an objects Tabs are used. 
Tabs in Salesforce are below types they are.
Custom Tabs.
Visualforce Tabs.
Web Tabs.
Lightning Component Tabs. 
### Question14: What are the Standard and Custom Fields for Custom Objects in Salesforce?
Standard Fields for custom objects stores the information about Id, Name, Owner, Created By Id, Last Modified By Id 
Custom field for custom objects stores unique data or information of an organization. For example, Gender__c, Email__c, Highest_Qualification__c & Salary__c etc. 
### Question15: What are the different types of Custom Fields and Relationships we have in Salesforce? 
There are basically three categories as below: 
Read Only Fields 
Auto Number 
Formula 
Rollup Summary 

Relationship Fields 
Lookup Relationship 
Master Detail Relationship 
External Lookup Relationship
Generic Fields 
Checkbox, Currency, Date, Date/Time, Email, Geolocation, Number, Percent, Phone, Picklist, Picklist (Multi-Select), Text, Text Area, Long Text Area, Time & URL etc. 
### Question16: What are the different types of Relationships in SFDC? What are they?
Relationship is used to link the two objects in Parent-Child combination. 
We need to create relationship field on child object and have to select parent object while creating relationship field. For example, select Faculty Object on Student Object while creating the field. 
They are four types of Relationships in Salesforce.com. They are
Look-up Relationship.
Master-Detail Relationship.
Self-Relationship.  
Many to Many Relationships (Junction Object). 
Look-up Relationship: 
Relationship is optional. No parent is required to create the child records.
There will be always owner field on child records. 
No impact on Security.
No Cascade record deletion. 
Roll-Up summary fields cannot be available.
25 look-up relationships can be created to one Object.

Master-Detail Relationship: 
Child record must have an associated parent. We cannot create child records without parent. 
There will not be any owner field on child records. Child records will be controlled by Parent. 
Cascade record-level security.
Cascade record deletion.
Roll-up Summary fields can be established.
Standard objects cannot be a detail object.
Standard Objects can be a Master object
Maximum 2 Master-Detail Relationships can be created to a Object.
Records can be re parented.


Self-Relationship: 
Self-Relationship is nothing but creating relationship between two same objects. 
This Self Relationship is a Look-up Relationship to the same object.
E.g., Parent Account on Account Object 


Many to Many Relationships (Junction Object): 
Many-Many Relationships between two objects can be created.
Junction Object is used to create Many-Many Relationships.
Junction object can also be called as Join Object.
Junction Object links each object in Many-Many Relationships.
E.g., Enrollment is Junction Object in between Student & Course 



### Question17: What are the Read Only Data Types – Auto Number, Formula & Rollup Summary?
Read Only Fields are the system generated fields and are in Read Only Nature. We cannot give any value while creating or updating any record. 
I. Auto Number: A system-generated sequence number that uses a display format you define. The number is automatically incremented for each new record.
E.g., Student Roll Number: RN-1000, Registration Number: R-1000, Appointment Number: AN-1000




ii. Formula: A read-only field that derives its value from a formula expression you define. The formula field is updated when any of the source fields change.
E.g., Calculate Discounted Fees for Male & Female Candidates. If Student is Male, then there should be of 10% discount and If Student is Female then there should be discount of 20%. 



iii. Rollup Summary: A read-only field that displays the sum, minimum, or maximum value of a field in a related list or the record count of all records listed in a related list.
Rollup summary is used to roll the information of child records to parent. 
Rollup summary field is available only if we have Master-Detail Relationship in between two objects. For example, Faculty (Parent Object) & Student (Child Object) 
Rollup summary field will be always created on Parent Object to summarize the information of respective child object. 
For example, in case of Faculty & Student Objects with Master-Detail Relationship, we always create Rollup Summary on Faculty and choose Student Object to summarize. 
There are four functions supported in Rollup Summary field 
COUNT 
SUM 
MIN 
MAX 
Examples using Rollup Summary Field: Faculty (Parent Object) & Student (Child Object)
Need to find out the total number of Students under each Faculty 
Need to find out the total number of Opportunities under each Account 
Need to find the total number of Closed Won Opportunities under each Account 
Need to find out the total number of Male Student under each Account 
Need to find out the total number of Female Student under each Account 
Need to find out the total Fees collected under each Faculty from all Students 
Need to find out the minimum fees amount paid under each Faculty 
Need to find out the maximum fees amount paid under each Faculty 

Below are the Examples which cannot be done using Rollup Summary, then need to go using other alternates I. Using Lightning Flow ii. Or write custom apex code using Apex Trigger 
Need to find out the total number of Contacts under each Account (Standard Behavior)
Need to find out the total number of Cases under each Account (Standard Behavior)
If we have any two objects with the Lookup Relationship. And need to count the total child records for each parent record. 
 

Examples: Rollup Summary 




### Question18: What is Page Layout in Salesforce?
Page layouts control the layout and organization of buttons, fields, s-controls, Visualforce, custom links, and related lists on object record pages. 
They also help determine which fields are visible, read only, and required. 
Use page layouts to customize the content of record pages for your users.
E.g., Three different Page Layouts on Student Object – Director Layout, Clerk Layout & Accountant Layout 

Director Layout:  


Accountant Layout: 

Clerk Layout: 
Q 19: What is Record Type in Salesforce? 
Record Type is used to assign Page Layouts to different Users. 
Record Type also controls the Picklist Values on Page Layouts. 
E.g., Director, Accountant & Clerk Layout Assignment 
Requirement 1: Need to assign Director Layout to Director Record Type so that User should get the behavior of Director Page Layout. 
Requirement 2: Need to assign Accountant Layout to Accountant Record Type so that User should get the behavior of Accountant Page Layout. 
Requirement 3: Need to assign Clerk Layout to Clerk Record Type so that User should get the behavior of Clerk Page Layout. 


E.g., Controlling the Picklist Values 
Requirement 1: For Director Layout, User should see Male & Female values under Gender Field. We can control this using Director Record Type 

Requirement 2: For Accountant Layout, User should see only Female value under Gender Field. We can control this using Accountant Record Type 

Requirement 3: For Clerk Layout, User should see only Male value under Gender Field. We can control this using Clerk Record Type 





### Question20: What is App in Salesforce? 
Classic apps are a collection of standard and custom tabs, including:
Most standard objects, including Home, the main Chatter feed, Groups, and People
Your org’s custom objects
Visualforce tabs
Lightning component tabs
Canvas apps via Visualforce tabs
Web tabs
Lightning apps are a collection of items that include everything from the Classic apps list, plus Lightning page tabs, and utilities like Sales Dialer. 
In Lightning apps, you can customize the app’s logo and enhance its branding by customizing the color of the navigation bar.
There are of three types of Apps: 
Standard Apps 
Custom Standard Apps 
Custom Console Apps
Standard Apps: Standard Apps are provided by Salesforce. 
E.g., Sales, Service, Marketing etc. 
Custom Standard Apps: Custom Standard Apps are created by Admin Users. 
E.g., School Management System, Hospital Management System etc. 
Custom Console Apps: Custom Standard Apps are created by Admin Users. These Apps provided the 360-degree view of the information. 
E.g., Call Center Service Console Apps 

### Question21: What is User in Salesforce?
A user is anyone who logs in to Salesforce. 
Users are employees at your company, such as admins, developers, testers, sales reps, customer support executives, managers, customer users, partner users and IT specialists, who need access to the company's records. 
Every user in Salesforce has a user account.
Profile is mandatory to create the Users. 
Role is not mandatory to create the Users. 









### Question22: What is Profile in Salesforce. How many types of Profile we have in Salesforce? 
A profile is a group/collection of settings and permissions that define what a user can do in salesforce.
You can define profiles by user’s job function. For example, System Administrator, Developer, Sales Representative, Support Agent, Customer External User, Partner External User, Vendor Portal etc. 
A profile can be assigned to many users, but user can be assigned single profile at a time.
Below are the few access settings and permissions can be controlled using Profile.

App Settings 
Tab Settings (Default On, Default Off, Tab Hidden)
Object Level Permissions (Read, Create, Edit, Delete, View All, Modify All)
Field Level Security (Read Access, Edit Access)
Page Layout Assignment 
Record Type Assignment 
Login Hours 
IP Ranges 
Session Settings 
Apex Class Access 
Visualforce Page Access 
Let’s consider we have one Profile Sales Rep. Users with Sales Rep profile must have below accesses: 
App Settings – Sales Rep should be able to access only Sales & Service Apps. 
Tab Settings – Sales Rep should see all the Tabs (Default On) except Orders (Tab Hidden), Faculties (Tab Hidden) & Students (Tab Hidden).  
Object Level Permissions (Read, Create, Edit, Delete, View All, Modify All): Below are few scenarios:  
E.g., Sales Rep Users should be able to read, create, update & delete Account, Contact & Opportunities Objects. Sales Rep Users should have only read and create access to Assets & Entitlements. Sales Rep Users should have only read access on Case Object. 
Field Level Security (Read Access, Edit Access) – Sales Reps should be able to only view (not be able to edit) Industry field on Account. And they should not be able to view Type Field on Account 
Page Layout Assignment – Let’s assume we have three Page Layouts on Account Object – Sales Reps Layout, Customer Layout & Partner Layout. So, Sales Rep should be able to access only Sales Reps Layout not the Customer Layout & Partner Layout. 
Record Type Assignment -- Let’s assume we have three Record Types on Account Object – Sales Reps, Customer & Partner. So, Sales Rep should be able to access only Sales Reps Record Type not the Customer & Partner Record Types.



Types of profiles in salesforce
  1. Standard profiles: 
By default, Salesforce provide few standard profiles – System Administrator, Standard User, Contact Manager, Customer Community Login & Partner Community User etc. 
  2. Custom Profiles: 
Custom ones defined by us. For example, Sales Rep, Support Agent, Salesforce Developer, Business Admin, Customer External User, Partner External User, Vendor Portal etc.

### Question23: What is Permission Set in Salesforce? 
A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that is used to provide the additional access to set of Users. 
For example, there is one Profile named Sales Rep which currently has access on Sales & Service Apps. So, all Users (let’s consider 100 Users) under Sales Rep profile will be able to access these two Apps. Now requirement is that I need to assign one more App ‘School Management System’ only to 5 Users out of 100 Users. 
Solution: We can create Permission Set which will contain the access of ‘School Management System’ App. We will assign this permission set to 5 Users. 

### Question24: What are the User Licenses are available in Salesforce?
Licenses depends on the Salesforce Editions – Developer, Group, Enterprise or Limited 
Below is the screenshot of Unlimited Edition 







Below is the screenshot of Developer Edition 


### Question25: Which types of Users you have used in your projects? 
We have used Internal & external both the Users in our project. 
Internal Users: Internal Users are used to access the Salesforce Internal Applications – Sales, Service, School Management System, Call Center Service Console & Hospital Management System etc. 
Note: Salesforce License is used to create the Internal Users. 
              E.g., System Administrators, Sales Rep, Support Agent, Business Admin & Support Managers etc. 
External Users: External Users are used to access the Salesforce External Applications – Community/ Portal/ Site. 
Note: Customer Community/Customer Community Login/Customer Community Plus License is used for External Customer Users
Note: Partner Community/ Partner Community Login License is used for Partner Users 

### Question26: What is Role in Salesforce?
A role is a record-level access in Salesforce that defines the visibility access of a user.
Roles can be used to specify the levels of access a user can have to data in your Salesforce organization. 
In simple words, it defines what a user can see in the Salesforce organization.
Role is represented under Role Hierarchy. 
Role is not mandatory to create a User. 
E.g., COE, VP Customer Service & Support, Vice President, Director, MD & Managers etc. 





### Question27: What is the difference in between Role & Profile?



Role
Profile
Roles are not mandatory for users. 
Profiles are mandatory for users. 
Roles are related to Record Level Sharing
Profiles are related to Actions, Access & Permissions 
Roles provide access to records visibility for the users.	
Profiles provide access control of CRED (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) records of the users.
It is basically a record level access.
It is basically an object and field level access.
It follows a hierarchy. Data visible permissions are given based on hierarchy. 	
It does not follow any hierarchy. Permissions are given based on the profile.
These can be imagined in the shape of a hierarchy where a higher role gets higher authority than the lesser one.	
These can be imagined in the shape of circles where all the profiles with the same function become a circle and get equal access.
The role is always dependent on the profile	
The profile can be independent of the role.
Roles control access to records and fields only.	
Profile control access to Objects, field-level security, page layouts, record types, and apps.


### Question28: What is Sharing Settings in Salesforce?

Sharing Settings: 
Sharing Settings is used to control the access on data at the record level – Read Access or Edit Access. 
In Salesforce, you can control access to data at many different levels. 
For example, you can control the access your users have to objects with object permissions. Within objects, you can control the access users have to fields using field-level security. Moreover,
To control access to data at the record level, use sharing settings.
There are several sharing mechanisms that you can use to configure record access for your users.
Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)
Private 
Public Read Only 
Public Read/Write 
Public Read/Write/Transfer 
Controlled By Parent 
Role Hierarchy
Sharing Rules
Based on record owner
Based on criteria
Manual Sharing
Apex Managed Sharing
There are few more additional sharing settings. 
### Question29: What is Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) under Sharing Settings?
Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) sharing settings give you a baseline level of access for each object and enable you to extend that level of access using Hierarchies or Sharing Rules. 
Note: In Salesforce, only System Administrator Profile Users & Record Owner have Full Access on Record. 
Below are the detailed accesses: 
Private: If OWD is Private, No one except the Owner can access the Records. 
Public Read Only: If OWD is Public Read Only, everyone in the Organization will be able to read the Records but No One except the Owner can modify the Records. 
Public Read/Write: If OWD is Public Read/Write, everyone in the Organization will be able to read and modify the Records. 
Public Read/Write/Transfer: If OWD is Public Read/Write/Transfer, everyone in the Organization will be able to read, modify & transfer the Records.
Controlled by Parent: It’s applicable in the case of Master-Detail Relationship. OWD for Child Object is inherited from Parent Object. 
E.g., Let’s consider Faculty & Student are two Parent-Child Objects with Master-Detail Relationship. If OWD on Parent is Private, then the same Private OWD will be applicable on Child Object because of Controlled by Parent. As Parent record is owner of child record in case of Master-Detail Relationship. 
### Question30: What is Role Hierarchy?
The role hierarchy automatically grants record access to users above the record owner in the hierarchy.
You can control sharing access using hierarchies for any custom object, but not standard objects.
Feature Name: Grant Access Using Hierarchies


E.g., Let’s Consider we have Private OWD for Faculty. Below are the Faculty Records with Owner, Owner’s Profile & Owner’s Role 
F1 – Owner U1 – Profile P1 – Role MD 
F2 – Owner U2 – Profile P1 – Role MD 
F3 – Owner U3 – Profile P2 – Role MD 

Note: There is Role Hierarchy. CEO Is on the top of Role MD on hierarchy. MD Role is reporting to CEO Role. There are two Users U4 & U4 with Profile P3 & CEO Role 

So, if Grant Access Using Hierarchies is enabled on Faculty, then CEO Role Users U3 & U4 will be able to access the F1, F2& F3 records even OWD is private. In other words, Top level Roles bypass the OWD settings if Grant Access Using Hierarchies feature is enabled. 

### Question31: What is Sharing Rules in Salesforce?

Sharing rules is used to give additional users access to records they don’t own. 
We can provide Read Only & Read/Write additional accesses. 
Sharing rules represent the exceptions to your organization-wide default settings. 
They allow you to extend record access to users regardless of their place in the role hierarchy.
If you have organization-wide sharing defaults of Public Read Only or Private, you can define rules that give additional users access to records they don’t own. 
Records can be shared with any Roles, Roles & Subordinates & Public Group. 
There are two types of Sharing Rules 
Based on record owner (Owner-Based Sharing Rule)
Based on criteria (Criteria-Based Sharing Rule)
Example 1/Scenario 1 for Sharing Rule – Based on record owner 
Let’s consider, if OWD for Faculty Object is Private and records are owned by MD Role Users. Now if we need to share the records owned by MD Role with CEO Role. We consider that COE and MD Roles are not on same level. 
So, we can create Sharing Rule based on record owner. 

Example 2/Scenario 2 for Sharing Rule – Based on criteria 
Let’s consider, if OWD for Faculty Object is Private. Now if we need to share the female faculty records with CEO Role. 
So, we can create Sharing Rule based on criteria. 


### Question32: What is Manual Sharing? 
Manual Sharing is used to provide additional access to set of Users, Roles, Roles & Subordinates & Public Groups. 


E.g., I want to share only specific Records to only set of Users regardless any OWD & Sharing Rules. Then we can share the records Manually while clicking on Sharing Button on Record. 

Screen after clicking on Sharing Button. 

Screens after clicking on Add Button 

### Question33: What is Salesforce Data Security Model?
Security in Salesforce is broadly classified in to two types. They are
Application-Level Security
System Level Security

Application-Level Security:  
Application-Level Security in Salesforce controls and restricts what the user can Edit, Delete and View the values of the field of an Object. 
This Salesforce security type is done after salesforce login.
Below are the Layers of Securities 

Layer 1: Object-level-security
Profiles
Permission sets 
Layer 2: Field-level-security
Layer 3: Record-level security
Record-level-security: Organization-Wide Defaults
Record-level-security: Role Hierarchies
Record-level-security: Sharing Rules
Record-level-security: Manual Sharing
Record-level-security: Apex Managed Sharing
         
System Level Security 
System Level Security in Salesforce is basically various security controls that we have to login into Salesforce Application.
Below are the Security Levels:

Authentication
Single Sign-On
Federated Authentication
Delegate Authentication

Authorization
OAuth
OpenID 

Social Sign On
Twitter
Facebook
Salesforce
Google
### Question34: What are Email Templates in Salesforce? 
Email Templates are the predefined content with Salesforce Record Information which can be used in Email Notifications i.e., Email Subject, Body & Signature etc. 
Email Templates basically save time & effort to avoid rewriting of emails. 
Use email templates to increase productivity and ensure consistent messaging. 
Email templates with merge fields let you quickly send emails that include field data from Salesforce records.
 

### Question35: What are the Automation Tools available in Salesforce?
Below are the Automation Tools we have: 
Assignment Rules 
Lead Assignment Rules 
Case Assignment Rules 
Case Escalation Rules 
Auto Response Rules 
Lead Auto Response Rules 
Case Auto Response Rules 
Workflow Rules (Email Alerts, New Task, Field Update & Outbound Message)
Process Builder (Apex, Create a Record, Email Alerts, Flows, Post to Chatter, Processes, Quick Actions, Quip, Send Custom Notification, Submit for Approval, Update Records)
Lightning Flow 
Screen Flow 
Record-Triggered Flow 
Scheduled-Triggered Flow 
Platform Event-Triggered Flow 
Auto launched Flow (No Trigger)
Approval Process 
Apex Triggers
### Question36: What is Queue & Public Group in Salesforce?
Queue: 
Queues allow groups of users to manage a shared workload more effectively. 
A queue is a location where records can be routed to await processing by a group member. 
The records remain in the queue until a user accepts them for processing or they are transferred to another queue. 
You can specify the set of objects that are supported by each queue, as well as the set of users that are allowed to retrieve records from the queue.




Public Group: 
A public group is a set of users. 
It can contain individual users, other groups, the users in a particular role or territory, or the users in a role or territory plus all of the users below that role or territory in the hierarchy.




### Question37: What are the Assignment Rules?
Assignment Rules are used to automatically assign records to users or queues based on criteria you define. 
Assignment Rules work only on two standard objects – Lead & Case 
In other words, there are of two types of Assignment Rules we have 

Lead Assignment Rules 
Case Assignment Rules 
 ### Question38: What is Lead Assignment Rule? 
Automatically assign leads to users or queues based on criteria you define. 
You can create multiple rules with different conditions, but only one rule can be active at a time.
Example, If Lead is created with Bangalore City, then this should be assigned to Bangalore Leads Queue & If Lead is created with Delhi City then this should be assigned to Delhi Leads Queue. 
Moreover, If Lead is created with Hyderabad & Noida respectively, then this should be assign to User Pankaj & Vipin. 



### Question39: What is Case Assignment Rule? 
Automatically assign cases to users or queues based on criteria you define. 
You can create multiple rules with different conditions, but only one rule can be active at a time.
Example, If Case is created with High Priority, then this should be assigned to High Priority Cases Queue & If Case is created with Medium Priority, then this should be assigned to Medium Priority Cases Queue & & If Case is created with Low Priority, then this should be assigned to Low Priority Cases Queue. 
Moreover, If Case is created without any Priority, then this should be assigned to User Pankaj. 




### Question40: What is Case Escalation Rule?
Automatically determine when cases should escalate and what actions to take. 
After you create a rule, select if from the rules list and add rule entries.
Example, If Case is assigned to any User (Support Agent). He must take actions within 4 hours to provide the resolution. But system finds no actions taken by Agent. So Case Ownership will be transfer automatically to another User after 4 hours. 




### Question41: What are the Auto Response Rules?
Auto Response Rules are used to send the email notification messages automatically once Leads & Cases are created using external systems (Web to Lead, Web to Case, Email to Lead & Email to Case).
Auto Response Rules work only on two standard objects – Lead & Case 
In other words, there are of two types of Auto Response Rules we have 

Lead Auto Response Rules 
Case Auto Response Rules 

### Question42: What is Workflow Rule? What are the actions we have in Workflow Rules?
Workflow Rule is one Automation Tool which is used to perform certain actions based on the criteria. 
Workflow in Salesforce is basically a container or business logic engine which automates certain actions based on criteria. 
If the criteria are met, the actions get executed. When they are not met, records will get saved but no action will get executed.
Below is the basic structure of a workflow rule in Salesforce:



The following actions can be triggered using workflow rules in Salesforce:

Email Alert: Sending an email
New Task: Assigning a task to someone
Field Update: Doing a field update
Outbound Message: Sending an outbound message to external system 

Types of actions present in a workflow in Salesforce:

Immediate actions: Actions that get executed immediately when a record is created or edited

Example 1: If Contact is created, Send Email Notification to the Contact Person.
Example 2: If Opportunity is Closed Won, Send Email Notification to Opportunity Owner & Opportunity Team
Example 3: If Case is Resolved/Closed, then Send Email Notification to Customer 
Example 4: If Lead is created, create one Follow up Task and assign to respective User. 
Example 5: If Opportunity Amount is more than 10000, then Update Stage of Opportunity with Qualification Value. 
Example 6: Let’s consider, we have two Systems – Salesforce & Order Management External System. If Order is created in Salesforce, then, we need to send Order Number & Order Amount from Salesforce to Order Management External System. 

Time-dependent actions: Actions that get executed after a certain duration of time, such as 10 days, before a record’s close date. After this time period, the workflow rules in salesforce will re-evaluate the record just to make sure that the rule criteria are met. If the record meets the criteria, the aligned actions will be executed.

Example 1: If Contact is created, Send Email Notification to the Contact Person just after 7 days of Contact Creation. 
Example 2: If Opportunity is Closed Won, Send Email Notification to Opportunity Owner & Opportunity Team 10 days before the Close Date on Opportunity. 

### Question43: What is Process Builder in Salesforce? How many types of Actions are available? 
Salesforce Process Builder is basically an automated tool that allows you to control the order of actions or evaluate the criteria for a record.
It is graphical presentation of doing the process in flow chart format. 
It has below eleven actions associated with it:

Apex
Create a Record
Email Alerts
Flows
Post to Chatter
Processes
Quick Actions
Quip
Send Custom Notification
Submit for Approval
Update Records

Example 1: If you need to invoke any logic (code) which is written in Apex Programming, then we can do using the Apex Action. 
Example 2: If Account is created then, Opportunity should be created automatically. This requirement we can do using Create a Record Action 
Example 3: If Contact is created then, Send Email Notification to Contact. Use Email Alerts Action. 
Example 4: If you want to invoke any Lightning Flow from Process Builder, then you can use Flows Action. 
Example 5: Process Builder in Salesforce allows you to post on Chatter for sharing any information with any user.
Example 6: Processes action will invoke a process to another process.
Example 7: If you already have global actions or objects, within Salesforce, then you can use quick action to use them in any record.
Example 8: Create documents, chat rooms, and folders when important events occur. Attach a document to a record so that your users have information in context.
Example 9: Send Custom Notification is used to send bell notifications to users. 
Example 10: The record that started your process can be submitted. Any other record cannot be automatically submitted.
Example 11: You can update one or more records that are somehow related to the record that started the process. This can be done either by manually entering the records or by using the records from a related record.




### Question44: What is Lightning Flow in Salesforce & How many types of Flows we have? 
A Salesforce flow, also known as Lightning flow, is an application used for automating complicated business processes. 
It allows users to gather specific datasets and performs automated processes using the same. 
Salesforce users can build individual flows based on their needs and preferences with the help of Flow Builder. 
Flow Builder allows you to develop code-like logic without the need for a programming language. 
This makes the process of building Salesforce flows easier and faster.



Types Of Salesforce Flows: Salesforce flows can be divided into five major categories as follows:

1. Auto launched Flows
These Salesforce flows can be used for running automated tasks in Salesforce. 
They can be invoked by users from process builder, Apex class, record changes, set schedule, or platform events.
2. Schedule-triggered Flows
These are auto launched flows that can be launched at a specific time and for a specific frequency for every record in batches. 
These flows run in the background for automating your business processes.
3. Screen Flows
These Salesforce flows have a distinct UI element and require inputs from Salesforce users. 
You can launch screen flows either as an action or embed them as an element on a Lightning page.

4. Record-triggered Flows
These are the auto launched flows that run in the background when a user creates, updates, or deletes Salesforce records.
5. Platform Event-triggered Flows
These Salesforce flows run in the background when a platform event message is received.

### Question45: What is Approval Process in Salesforce?
Approval Process is basically used to Submit, Approve & Reject the Records in Salesforce. 
Example 1: If Employee is asking Leave for more than 10 Days, then Leave Request requires approval of Manager. 
Example 2: If Employee is Submitting the Expense Report of Visa Fees, Travel Tickets, Accommodation & Food etc., then Expense requires the Approval of Manager, Auditor & Finance Team. 
### Question46: Can we delete User Record in Salesforce?
No, we cannot delete the User Record in Salesforce. 
We can either deactivate or freeze the User to block the login access. 

### Question47: What is the difference between freeze user and deactivate user in Salesforce?
Both options prevent the login access of User in Salesforce. 
Freezing only stops the user from being able to login. 
When you deactivate, it frees up that salesforce license to be given to another user




### Question48: What is Data Migration in Salesforce?  What are the recommendations before doing a Data Migration?
Data Migration is the process of moving or transferring data from the Salesforce to the destination such as Databases, Data Warehouses, or applications.
Data Migration is also used to process the Data i.e., export, insert, update, upsert & delete within Salesforce. 
Here are some recommendations to keep in mind during data migration:

Preparation of the migration process
Optimization of the data model
Backup
Timely information
Selection of a data migration tool
Preparation of the migration process: those in charge of this process must carefully design all the steps that, from a technical point of view, will be necessary to carry out the data migration. A correct mapping process; proper relationship and order between the records, data format, compatibility checking and assurance; just to cite a few examples.
Optimization of the data model: the migration process is the ideal time to review the data structure the organization has and optimize it, either integrating elements or eliminating unnecessary ones.
Backup: If the data migration process is prepared and executed efficiently, it should not cause any problems. But in case things go wrong, having a backup copy is vital to ensure the integrity of the data.
Timely information: Keeping all stakeholders informed about the data migration process and the stages it will go through is critical. In this way, disagreements are avoided and the benefits of the process are better used.
Selection of a data migration tool: once we have defined our goal with the migration process, we must choose the appropriate tool to carry it out. It must be considered to what extent the benefits of each tool correspond to the needs and possibilities of the entity.

### Question49: What are the Salesforce Data Migration Tools? 
The tools that perform data migration are of the ETL type (extract, transform and load) and there are a wide variety available.
Below are below top tools used by Users 

Salesforce Data Import Wizard
Salesforce Data Loader
Dataloader.io
Salesforce Workbench 
Salesforce Inspector

We can process up to 5 million of records at a time. 
We cannot remove the Duplicates using Data Loader. 
Only CSV Files are supported during Operations. 




### Question50: What is Reports in Salesforce & How many types of Reports are there? 
Reports in Salesforce is a list of records which are displayed as a table that can be filtered or grouped based on any field.
There are 4 types of report formats in Salesforce Classic Experience 
Tabular Reports
Summary Reports
Matrix Report 
Joined Reports 
We do not have any report format in Salesforce Lightning Experience

Salesforce Classic Experience: 
Tabular Report 
This is the most basic report format. 
It just displays the row of records in a table with a grand total. 
While easy to set up they can’t be used to create groups of data or charts and cannot be used in Dashboards. 
They are mainly used to generate a simple list or a list with a grand total.



Summary Report 
It is the most used type of report. 
It allows grouping of rows of data, view subtotal, and create charts.
It allows up to 3 levels of grouping on rows
Grouping will be always on Picklist type of field. 




Matrix Report
It is the most complex report format. 
Matrix report summarizes information in a grid format. 
It allows records to be grouped by both columns and rows. 
It can also be used to generate dashboards. 
Charts can be added to this type of report.
It allows up to 3 levels of grouping on rows
Grouping will be always on Picklist type of field. 



Joined Reports
These types of reports let us create different views of data from multiple report types. 
The data is joined reports are organized in blocks. 
Each block acts as a sub report with its own fields, columns, sorting, and filtering. 
They are used to group and show data from multiple report types in different views

Salesforce Lightning Experience: 








### Question51: What is Dashboard in Salesforce?
Dashboards in Salesforce are a graphical representation of Reports. 
It shows data from source reports as visual components. 
These components provide a snapshot of key metrics and performance indicators of the organization at a glimpse.
There are 5 types of components in Salesforce Dashboard:
1. Charts
Used for showing comparisons. 
These are further divided into 6 types:
Line Chart
Vertical Bar Chart
Horizontal Bar Chart
Donut
Pie
Funnel
2. Table
Tables are used for showing lists. 
For example, top five or bottom five opportunities.
3. Gauge
Gauge is used to show progress towards a goal.
4. Metric
Metrics are used to show a single number like a grand total from a report with a label specified.
5. Visualforce
Visualforce is used to show a visualforce component as a dashboard. 
It is used to pull data from other data sources.



### Question52: How we can Schedule/Subscribe the Reports & Dashboards?

We can schedule on Frequency – Daily, Weekly & Monthly at any specific time. 

Frequency – Daily: 

Frequency – Weekly: 



Frequency – Monthly: 





### Question53: What is SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)?

It is used to retrieve data from Salesforce database according to the specified conditions and objects. 
Use SOQL when you know which objects the data resides in, and you want to:
Retrieve data from a single object or from multiple objects that are related to one another.
Count the number of records which meet the specified criteria.
Sort results as part of the query.
Retrieve data from number, date, or checkbox fields.
SELECT Id, Name, Industry, Type, Phone, Rating FROM Account
SELECT Id, Industry, Name, Phone, Rating, Type FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Technology' AND Name LIKE '%Mindtree%' ORDER BY Name ASC
SELECT Id, Name, Email__c, Father_Name__c, Gender__c, Highest_Qualification__c,Salary__c FROM Faculty__c
There are of two types of SOQL Queries:

Child to Parent Relationship Query 
If you need to retrieve the data from child as well as parent objects, while writing query on child object. 
Example 1: Retrieve the data of Contact & related Account 
select ID, Name, Email, Phone, AccountId, Account.Name, Account.Type, Account.Industry from Contact
Example 2: Retrieve the data of Student & related Faculty 
select ID, Name, Fees__c, Gender__c, Faculty__c, Faculty__r.Name, Faculty__r.Gender__c, Faculty__r.Email__c from Student__c
Parent to Child Relationship Query 
If you need to retrieve the data of parent along with all child objects, while writing query on parent object. 
Example 1: Retrieve the data of Account along with associated Contacts & Opportunities 
select Id, Name, Type, Industry, (select Id, Name, Email from Contacts), (select Id, Name from Opportunities) from Account
whereas Contacts & Opportunities in query are not the Object Names, these are Child Relationship Name. 
Example 2: Retrieve the data of Faculty along with associated Students 
select Id, Name, (select Id, Name from Students__r) from Faculty__c
whereas Students is not the Object Name, it’s Child Relationship Name. In case of custom object, accessed using Students__r 
### Question54: What is SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language)?
SOSL is a highly optimized way of searching records in Salesforce across multiple Objects that are specified in the query. 
A SOSL query returns a list of list of sObjects and it can be performed on multiple objects.
A SOSL query performs search only on Name, Text, Email & Phone Data types. 
Example, Find the list of Records with Mindtree keyword from Account, Contact & Opportunity Objects. 
FIND {Mindtree} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (ID, Name, Type, Industry), Contact (ID, Name, Email), Opportunity (Id, Name, CloseDate, StageName)
FIND {Mindtree} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Account (ID, Name, Type, Industry), Contact (ID, Name, Email), Opportunity (Id, Name, CloseDate, StageName)
FIND {Mindtree} IN PHONE FIELDS RETURNING Account (ID, Name, Type, Industry), Contact (ID, Name, Email), Opportunity (Id, Name, CloseDate, StageName)
FIND {Mindtree} IN EMAIL FIELDS RETURNING Account (ID, Name, Type, Industry), Contact (ID, Name, Email), Opportunity (Id, Name, CloseDate, StageName)
Example, Find the list of Records with Mindtree keywork from Account related to Technology Industry 
FIND {Mindtree} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (ID, Name, Type, Industry where Industry='Technology')

### Question55: What is the difference in between SOQL & SOSL?

SOQL
SOSL
SOQL retrieves the records from the database by using “SELECT” keyword.
SOSL retrieves the records from the database by using the “FIND” keyword.
We can retrieve data from single object or from multiple objects that are related to each other.
We can retrieve multiple objects and field values efficiently when the objects may or may not be related to each other.
We can Query on only one table.
We can query on multiple tables.
By Using SOQL we can know in Which objects or fields the data resides.
By using SOSL, we don’t know in which object or field the data resides.
SOQL can be used in both Apex Classes & Apex Triggers. 
SOSL can be used only in Apex Classes. 
We can perform DML Operations (Insert, Update, Delete, Upsert etc.) on the data retrieved using SOQL. 
We cannot perform the DML Operations on the data retrieved using SOSL Query 




### Question56: What is MVC Architecture in Salesforce? 
MVC stands for Model View Controller. 
Model: Database.com i.e., Objects or Tables 
View: Presentation Layer i.e., User Interface 
Page Layouts 
Visualforce Framework (for Salesforce Classic): Visualforce Tags, HTML, CSS, Java Script etc. 
Aura Component Framework (for Salesforce Lightning Experience): Aura Tags, HTML, CSS, Java Script etc. 
Lightning Web Component Framework (for Salesforce Lightning Experience): Custom HTML Tags, HTML, CSS, Java Script etc. 
Controller: Business Logic i.e., using Apex Programming 

### Question57: Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous in Apex? 
Synchronous Apex:
In a Synchronous call, the thread will wait until it completes its tasks before proceeding to next. 
In a Synchronous call, the code runs in single thread.

Apex Class
Apex Trigger 

Example 1: Apex Logic to create the record using Custom UI.
Example 2: Apex Logic to search the data using Custom UI. 
Example 3: Apex Logic to do automation based on any DML Operation using Apex Trigger 
Asynchronous Apex: 
In an Asynchronous call, the thread will not wait until it completes its tasks before proceeding to next. 
Instead, it proceeds to next leaving it run in separate thread. 
Asynchronous Apex runs in Background 
In an Asynchronous call, the code runs in multiple threads which helps to do many tasks as background jobs.
There are 4 approaches used in Asynchronous Apex:

Future Methods
Queueable Apex 
Schedulable Apex 
Batch Apex 

Example 1: Apex Logic which you need to execute in background as a separate transaction which will help to hit the Governor Limits. 
Example 2: Apex Logic which you need to schedule at any specific time i.e., send email notification to Contacts daily 1 AM in night. 
Example 3: Apex Logic which you need to schedule at any specific time i.e., send credit card bank statements notification to Customers on each 20th of month at 1 AM in night. 
Example 4: Apex Logic to handle more than 50000 records in a single transaction. So, we can split the records into multiple batches. 
Example 5: Apex Logic to update last number of records each night based on criteria. So, we can split the records into multiple batches. 

### Question58: What are the Governor Limits in Salesforce?
Because Apex runs in a multitenant environment, the Apex runtime engine strictly enforces limits so that runaway Apex code or processes don’t monopolize shared resources. 
If some Apex code exceeds a limit, the associated governor issues a runtime exception that can’t be handled.

Per-Transaction Apex Limits: 



### Question59: Sample Code – Apex, Visualforce Page, Lightning Aura Component Framework, Lightning Web Component Framework

Lightning Web Component Framework: 



### Question60: What is Salesforce Integration?
When we talk about integration, it means to create a connection between a specific Salesforce instance and another database or system. 
Integration is used to exchange the information in between two or multiple systems. 
The connection could be inbound, outbound, or bi-directional, and you may be connecting to another database, another Salesforce instance, or another cloud-based data source. 
Integrations can be focused on sharing data between systems or continuing a business process automation from one system to another.
Reference link: https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2021/introduction-to-integration 














### Question61: Why do customers integrate Salesforce?
Reference link: https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2021/introduction-to-integration 
Salesforce is a very powerful tool because it helps companies to create a 360-degree view of their customers and their business. 
Integrations with additional databases can bring even more value and information into your Salesforce environment. 
As Salesforce Admins, we can make important data accessible to our end users, and we are often in the position to make decisions about what integrations would benefit our company. 
Here, we will discuss some of the most common use cases for integration.

Bringing External Data into Salesforce
Referencing external data inside of Salesforce
Transform and enrich Salesforce data
Extract insights from Salesforce and external data
Salesforce multi-org consolidation
Data integration/sync data across non-Salesforce systems
Publish/subscribe integration model
Third-party application needs to integrate with Salesforce environment

Bringing External Data into Salesforce

A very common integration use case is exposing data from an external system inside of your Salesforce environment. 
This approach can help establish Salesforce as the single source of truth for your company data.
E.g., Bringing External Data into Salesforce from Legacy System. This may be one time activity or daily nighty basis activity. 

Referencing external data inside of Salesforce

Although this use case sounds like the one listed above, it is slightly different. 
You may want to centralize your user experience on Salesforce, but not import and manage that data inside of Salesforce. 
In this use case, your users can be informed and act on records from other systems, without the data management overhead of importing and managing potential data replication issues.
E.g., Let’s consider we have Major Data Stored in External Systems (SAP/SQL/ORACLE) and applications are implemented on Salesforce Platforms. We have only minimal data stored in Salesforce i.e., Account, Contacts & Users etc. So, to process the functionalities we can reference the data inside of Salesforce from the external systems. We can reference this data either on demand or on nightly basis. 

Transform and enrich (improve quality of data) Salesforce data

Data Transformation & Data enrichment plays important role in Integration 
E.g., Mulesoft ESB Middleware provides capability to transform the data from one form to another form i.e., XML to JSON or JSON to XML etc.
E.g., We have multiple ETL tools which improve the quality of data as part of Data Integration. 

Extract insights from Salesforce and external data

Consolidate your data from Salesforce and external systems for comprehensive analytics. 
In this use case, you may want to centralize all your data onto Salesforce and use Salesforce tools to augment and manage your data.
E.g., Einstein Analytics 

Salesforce multi-org consolidation
Some of our customers have many Salesforce environments and want to consolidate the data for consistency across channels — and build custom apps and experiences that leverage all their Salesforce data.
E.g., Salesforce to Salesforce Integration 
Data integration/sync data across non-Salesforce systems
This use case is applicable if you have a collection of disconnected cloud and/or on-premises systems that need to share data with one another. 
There are data integration use cases across systems that do not include Salesforce. 

Publish/subscribe integration model

For scalable integration patterns that will grow with your data structure, some customers leverage an event-driven architecture to integrate across their systems.
When events in one system take place, other relevant systems should be able to immediately recognize those events and carry out subsequent actions, such as updating a case or restocking inventory.

Third-party application needs to integrate with Salesforce environment

In this scenario, there is a business need to make your Salesforce data or processes available to external or third-party systems.
E.g., Temperature based on Customer’s Location from Salesforce to Temperature 3rd Party App

### Question63: What are the Sandboxes in Salesforce?
Salesforce sandboxes are copies of your Production environment.
You can create multiple copies of your organization in separate environments for different purposes such as development, testing and training, without compromising the data and applications in your production organization.
Sandboxes are completely isolated from your Salesforce production organization, so operations you perform in your sandboxes do not affect your Salesforce production organization, and vice versa.

Example, you have Purchased Salesforce License for Unlimited Editions. You will get a few Sandbox Copies of Production Environment. You can create multiple Sandboxes for different Purposes:

Sandbox 1: May be called Dev Sandbox which we can be used for Development Activity. This will be used by Development Team. 
Sandbox 2: May be called SIT Sandbox which we can be used for QA SIT Testing. This will be used by QA SIT Testing Team. 
Sandbox 3: May be called UAT Sandbox which we can be used for UAT Testing. This will be used by UAT Testing Team. 
Sandbox 4: May be called Hotfix Sandbox which we can be used for Development Activity. This will be used by Development Team to fix the Bugs came directly from Production and need quick/urgent fixes. 


### Question64: What are the types of Sandboxes we have in Salesforce?
Salesforce provides majorly four types of Sandboxes. They are briefly discussed below:
Developer Sandbox
Developer Pro Sandbox
Partial Copy Sandbox
Full Sandbox

Development Team: Usually Use either Developer or Developer Pro Sandboxes 
QA SIT Team: Usually Use either Developer Pro or Partial Copy Sandboxes 
UAT Team: Usually Use either Partial Copy or Full Copy Sandboxes 
Other Testing Activities: Performance Testing, Load Testing & Staging in Full Copy Sandbox 


### Question65: What is Deployment Process in Salesforce?
Deployment Process is basically the process of moving the metadata from one Organization to another Organization. For example, 

Step 1: Development Team started & completed the requirements in Sandbox 1 i.e., Dev Sandbox. 
Step 2: Development Team/Release Management Team need to release the requirements for QA SIT Testing. So, they must move the metadata changes from Sandbox 1 i.e., Dev Sandbox to Sandbox 2 i.e., SIT Sandbox. 
Step 3: QA Team completed the Testing in Sandbox 2 i.e., SIT Sandbox and provided Sign Off. 
Step 4: Development Team/Release Management Team need to release the requirements for UAT Testing. So, they must move the metadata changes from Sandbox 2 i.e., SIT Sandbox to Sandbox 3 i.e., UAT Sandbox.
Step 5: UAT Team completed the Testing in Sandbox 3 i.e., UAT Sandbox and provided Sign Off. 
Step 4: Development Team/Release Management Team need to release the requirements for Production Go-Live. So, they must move the metadata changes from Sandbox 3 i.e., UAT Sandbox to Production i.e., have the real time application. 

### Question66: What are the different options for deploying Salesforce changes?
Change Sets
DevOps
ANT Migration Tool
Salesforce DX
Note: In my current project, we are using DevOps methodology in our project for Deployment Process. And in my previous projects, we were using Change Sets. 
### Question67: What is Change Sets?
Change Sets are used to deploy the changes from one Organization to another Organization. 
There are two types of Change Sets: 

Outbound Change Sets
Inbound Change Sets
Outbound Change Sets: 
An outbound change set contains customizations that you want to send from this organization to another organization. 
These customizations can include new components or modifications to existing components, such as apps, objects, reports, or Apex classes and triggers.




Inbound Change Sets:
An inbound change set contains customizations sent from another organization to this one. 
These customizations can include new components or modifications to existing components, such as apps, objects, reports, or Apex classes and triggers. 



### Question68: What is DevOps in Salesforce?
Reference Link: https://gearset.com/blog/salesforce-devops-what-is-it/ 
'DevOps' is a set of practices designed to help teams build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. 
It stems from the need to combine the responsibilities of both software development teams ('Dev') and operations teams ('Ops').
The benefits of DevOps:
A higher frequency of new releases to production
Shorter lead times for making changes and developing new features
Fewer bugs and fewer service disruptions due to poor quality code
Faster restore times in the event of service outages

### Question69: What are the pillars of DevOps which make it successful?
Reference Link: https://gearset.com/blog/salesforce-devops-what-is-it/ 
Below are few pillars: 
Pillar 1: Version control for faster, more reliable development and collaboration
Pillar 2: Continuous Integration/ Continuous Development - CI/CD for rapid, continual added value without manual repetition
Pillar 3: Automated testing for bug-free, clean code that you can rely on
Pillar 4: Backup for swift and complete disaster recovery

### Question70: What are the Validation Rules in Salesforce and why we use them? 
Validation Rules are used to improve the Quality of Data in Salesforce. 
Validation Rules are used to validate the Data in Salesforce.
Validation Rules are fired only if we create the new records, or we update the existing records. 

Example 1: Phone Number must be of exactly 10 digits 


Example 2: ZIP Code must be of exactly 6 digits. 

Example 3: Start Date & End Date cannot be Equal. 



Example 4: End Date cannot be in Past. 









Example 5: If there are two fields, No Email (with checkbox data type) and Email (with email data type), If we want to keep Email as Optional then User must click on No Email checkbox field, otherwise Email will be required field. 





Example 6:  There is Status picklist field on Case Object with set of values – New, In Progress, Resolved and Closed. If we change the Status of Case to Resolved, then Resolution Justification field is required to give some details. 





Example 7: There is Status picklist field on Case Object with set of values – New, In Progress, Resolved, Change Pending & Closed. We must validate the scenarios as below: 
Case Status cannot be changed from New to Resolved 
Case Status cannot be changed from New to Closed 
                


Example 8: For New Opportunity, Amount cannot be more than 10000 & for existing Opportunity Amount cannot be more than 20000.
